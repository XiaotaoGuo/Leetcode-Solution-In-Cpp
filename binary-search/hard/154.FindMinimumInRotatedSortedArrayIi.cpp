 *
 * Suppose an array of length n sorted in ascending order is rotated between 1
 * and n times. For example, the array nums = [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] might
 * become:
 *
 *
 * [4,5,6,7,0,1,4] if it was rotated 4 times.
 * [0,1,4,4,5,6,7] if it was rotated 7 times.
 *
 *
 * Notice that rotating an array [a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-1]] 1 time results
 * in the array [a[n-1], a[0], a[1], a[2], ..., a[n-2]].
 *
 * Given the sorted rotated array nums that may contain duplicates, return the
 * minimum element of this array.
 *
 *
 * Example 1:
 * Input: nums = [1,3,5]
 * Output: 1
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [2,2,2,0,1]
 * Output: 0
 *
 *
 * Constraints:
 *
 *
 * n == nums.length
 * 1 <= n <= 5000
 * -5000 <= nums[i] <= 5000
 * nums is sorted and rotated between 1 and n times.
 *
 *
 *
 * Follow up: This is the same as Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array but with
 * duplicates. Would allow duplicates affect the run-time complexity? How and
 * why?
